# MIDTERM PROJECT DOCUMENTATION


    For my project I would like to incorperate both FFT, and OSC messages. I would like to use FFT for the song of the piece, which will be an original that I have been working on for a good while. For OSC messages I would like to make a patch in pure data which sends midi data from my midi controller, and use said midi messages to control the visuals of the piece. 

    I feel like I have enough experience with Max for live to get an addiquate familiarity with Pure Date, so creating a patch which works with my midi device shouldnt be too hard. 

    I would like to incorperate the usage of actual pictures, in a way that doesnt take up too much CPU power. 


## UPDATE ON MY INITIAL PLAN.
I have given up on trying to get pure data to work with open frameworks. I have also just given up on 
using midi in general. Ive attempted for around 2 hours to get it to work, and I just cannot figure it 
out, especially with such a heavy loaded midterm this semester. Instead I am going the FFT route to create a
visualizer for a song that I wrote, and my band has just recently released. 

first thing:

I need a place to start off on, I have decided to base this project on this tutorial, by Dan Buzzo

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijeb3wp0jqg&ab_channel=danbuzzo

I followed this tutorial step by step, and got a starting place that I am very happy with. 

I will also include all of the resorces that I followed for De-Bugging, and attempting to get Midi to work, and my entire conversation with 
Chat GPT, full of debugging, and figuring things out.

Yeah as you can see from the chat gpt log, there was so much de bugging, I hate relying on AI, but i was so lost
for a good portion of coding this, and It honestly was a huge help with debugging, and getting ideas started. 


## WHAT IS MY PROJECT?

A conglomeration of patches that we learned in past classes + things ive figured out through youtube tutorials + chat gpt debugging all
put on top of a tik tok of 2 cats fighting. The GUI Sliders adjust the unfilled shapes, and the hue and saturation of the project. The left
and right keyboard buttons make the video faster and slower. The up and down buttons, also mess with the hue and saturation. I hope you enjoy!!

## MAIN ISSUES I ENCOUNTERED 

Midi not working:

I installed new extentions, and followed tutorials, but I couldnt figure it out. 
Even if I did end up figuring it out, I wouldnt have known how to go about programming my project with midi implementation. 
Looking back at how it turned out, I would probably have attempted to connect the GUI sliders to CC's 

Saturation and Hue:

The Saturation wasnt that big of a deal, but I couldnt for the life of me find a way to get the hue back to the original colors of the video.
this took SO MUCH DEBUGGING and coming up with different ideas 

VIDEO PLAYER RUNNING AT LIKE 2 FRAMES A SECOND:

So originally the cat video that I used was just suppost to be a placeholder. I recorded a music video for this song, that I was going
to edit later on down the line, but I thought it would be cool to use it in this project as well. Whenever I would import any sort of 
long video including my music video clip, the project would run so unbelivably slow. 


## HOW I FIXED THESE ISSUES

Midi Not Working:

I GAVE UP ! 

Saturation and Hue:

After a very long time of debugging, instead of attempting to have the saturation and hue react to the FFT
I decided to make a bunch of Gui Sliders to give myself control of how the visuals are effected. 

Video Player Running:

After tons of debugging, I could not find a fix for this. I decided to make the cat video placeholder the centerpiece 
for this project, and honestly I cant complain.
