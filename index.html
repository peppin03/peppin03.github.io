<li>MC BBL</li>
<li>Introducing MC BBL (aka QUEEN of Hip-Hop), the rap sensation who's not just here to drop beats, but to drop jaws with her unique style! Born in the vibrant streets of Funkytown, MC BBL has a flair for the extraordinary, mixing rhymes like a mad scientist mixes potions. Rolling Stone described her as ‘greatest rap star of 21st century’, ‘hardest working artist’ as she can practice 40 hours a day. 
What can she do? Imagine rhymes about space-traveling llamas, rapping robots, and her famous love ballad to a time-traveling toaster. Her beats? A bizarre blend of traditional hip-hop, electronic funk, and random sound effects including kitchen utensils and video game blips.
Welcome to the wacky world of MC BBL, a carnival of lights, sounds, and unexpected guest appearances ranging from holographic dinosaurs to beatboxing grandmas!

<li>Control V is one of the most legendary rhymers to cross Section 2 of LMSC 261. Big CSS has a heavier flow than the Nile.</li><br>
<li><li>Meet Lil C+. An artsit of little words but lots of raps and super hard bars that puts Nas. Logic, and 2 Chainz to shame.</li></li>

<li>‘They call me the rhyme architect, spitting words like a poet,</li>
<li>From the struggle of the streets, my success is the quotient.</li>
<li>I paint pictures with verses, my life's a canvas,</li>
<li>Rap game royalty, call me the lyrical monarch, no antics.’</li>
